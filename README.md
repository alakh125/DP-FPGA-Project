# DP-FPGA-Project
Personal project with the intention to implement Dynamic Programming concepts in digital hardware. Used the n-th Fibonacci number calculation problem. Includes Pseudocode for reduced memory CS implementation of DP algorithm in Java, and developed code for low memory and high speed implementation in System Verilog
